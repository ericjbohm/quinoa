@section goveqns Governing equations for multi-material hydrodynamics
The stiff velocity equilibrium multi-material hydrodynamic equations are
considered in this work. In this system, although all the materials are advected
with the same velocity \f$u_j\f$, they possess different pressures and internal
energies. Finite pressure relaxation source terms are added to the material
volume fraction and material total energy equations based on the material
bulk-modulii. The Eulerian form of this multi-material system of equations is,
\f[ \begin{split}
\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{U}}{\partial t} 
+ \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{F}_j}{\partial x_j} 
+ \boldsymbol{D} = \boldsymbol{S},
\end{split} \f]
where,
\f[ \begin{split}
& \boldsymbol{U} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha_k \\
\alpha_k \rho_k \\
\overline{\rho} u_i \\
\alpha_k \rho_k E_k
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\boldsymbol{F}_j =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
\alpha_k \rho_k u_j \\
\overline{\rho} u_i u_j + \overline{p} \delta_{ij} \\
\alpha_k \rho_k H_k u_j
\end{bmatrix}, \\
& \boldsymbol{D} =
\begin{bmatrix}
u_j \frac{\partial \alpha_k}{\partial x_j} \\
0 \\
0 \\
Y_k u_j \frac{\partial \overline{p}}{\partial x_j}
  - u_j \frac{\partial (\alpha_k p_k)}{\partial x_j}
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\boldsymbol{S} =
\begin{bmatrix}
S_{\alpha,k} \\
0 \\
0 \\
-\overline{p} S_{\alpha,k}
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{split} \f]
where \f$k=1,2,...,m\f$ and \f$m\f$ is the number of materials. \f$\alpha_k\f$
is the volume-fraction of material-\f$k\f$. Bulk properties such as density
\f$\overline{\rho}\f$, pressure \f$\overline{p}\f$, and internal energy
\f$\overline{\rho e}\f$ are defined as,
\f[ \begin{split}
\overline{\phi} = \sum_k \alpha_k \phi_k,
\end{split} \f]
where \f$\phi_k\f$ is the material density \f$\rho_k\f$, material pressure
\f$p_k\f$, or material internal energy \f$\rho_k e_k\f$ as required. The
specific total energy of material-\f$k\f$ is, \f$E_k = e_k + u_j u_j/2\f$, and
its specific total enthalpy is, \f$H_k = E_k + p_k/\rho_k\f$,
where \f$e_k\f$ is the specific internal energy of the material.
\f$Y_k = \alpha_k \rho_k/\overline{\rho}\f$ is the mass fraction of
material-\f$k\f$. The source term \f$S_{\alpha,k}\f$ consists of the finite
pressure relaxation. Note that although the
material total energy equations are written in a non-conservative form, the
mixture total energy equation (\f$\rho E = \sum_k \alpha_k \rho_k E_k\f$) is a
conservative equation (non-conservative terms cancel when summed over all
materials). Thus, total energy of the system is conserved. The system is closed
by specifying equations of state for each material, usually
in the form of \f$p_k = p_k(\rho_k, e_k)\f$.

@section prelax Finite-rate pressure relaxation
A mixed-cell pressure closure \f$S_{\alpha,k}\f$ has to be specified for the
above system of equations to be complete. This term accounts for volume
fraction redistribution due to differential compaction. This term attempts to
model the different amount of compression in materials caused by unequal
material compressibilities, by redistributing pressure-induced volume changes
based on material bulk modulii. This redistribution of volume fractions results
in a finite amount of relaxation between material pressures. The functional form
is similar to Tipton's closure. The volume redistribution is given by,
\f[ \begin{split}
S_{\alpha,k} = \frac{1}{\tau} (p_k-p^*)\frac{\alpha_k}{\mathcal{K}_k},
\end{split} \f]
where \f$p^*\f$ is the equilibrium pressure that the multi-material cell is
expected to reach after sufficient time:
\f[ \begin{split}
p^* = \frac{\sum_k \left( p_k \frac{\alpha_k}{\mathcal{K}_k} \right)}
  {\sum_k \frac{\alpha_k}{\mathcal{K}_k}},
\end{split} \f]
\f$\mathcal{K}_k = \rho_k a_{k}^2\f$ is the material's bulk modulus,
and \f$\tau\f$ is the pressure-equilibration time-scale,
\f[ \begin{split}
\tau = c_{\tau} \max_k \left( \frac{h}{a_k} \right).
\end{split} \f]
The constant \f$c_{\tau}\f$ adjusts the pressure equilibration rate of the
materials in mixed cells. It controls how fast the pressure relaxation takes
place in a mixed cell, as compared to the sound-crossing speed in that cell
\f$(h/a_k)\f$. The value of \f$c_{\tau}\f$ can be specified in the input file.

@section eos Equations of state
Currently, the stiffened-gas equation of state (SG-EoS) is used to close the PDE
system. This EoS can be used to describe materials ranging from ideal gases to
stiff liquid-like fluids. The internal energy, temperature and speed of sound
for material-\f$k\f$ using the SG-EoS are:
\f[ \begin{split}
\rho_k e_k &= \frac{p_k+P_{\text{c}_k}}{\gamma_k-1} + P_{\text{c}_k}, \\
T_k &= \left( \frac{\gamma_k}{\gamma_k-1} \right) \frac{p_k+P_{\text{c}_k}}{\rho_k C_{\text{p}_k}}, \\
a_k &= \sqrt{\gamma_k \frac{p_k+P_{\text{c}_k}}{\rho_k}},
\end{split} \f]
where \f$P_{\text{c}_k}\f$, \f$\gamma_k\f$, \f$C_{\text{p}_k}\f$, and \f$T_k\f$
are the stiffness parameter, heat capacity ratio, specific heat at constant
pressure, and temperature for material-$k$ respectively.

More complex equations of state are a topic of future work.

@section tmpdiscr Temporal discretization
The temporal and spatial derivatives are discretized separately resulting in a
method of lines. A 3rd order total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta
scheme is used to discretize the time derivatives.

@section spcdiscr Spatial discretization
A modal Reconstructed Discontinuous Galerkin (rDG) method is used to discretize
the multi-material system in space. The specific rDG method implemented in
Quinoa uses Dubiner's orthogonal basis functions (see the @ref inciter_dg
"DG page" for more details). Reconstruction to higher order
is via a least-squares procedure based on node-neighbors. Fluxes through
cell-faces are calculated using multi-material Riemann solvers. Non-linear
instabilities are suppresed using a vertex-based limiter. Further details can be
found in the @ref papers_inciter "Inciter papers".

@section intreco Algebraic interface reconstruction
Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface Capturing (THINC) is used to algebraically
reconstruct material interfaces in the domain. THINC assumes a smooth
distribution of volume fractions across the interface, using the \f$\tanh\f$
function. This results in sharp interface capturing, without expensive geometric
procedures. The THINC scheme can be tuned to capture material interfaces in 2-4
cells. Due to the smooth nature of the \f$\tanh\f$ function, stability concerns
are mitigated.

For further details about the numerical method, see @ref papers_inciter
"Inciter papers".
